    "text": "Deep breathing is a simple exercise that we can do anytime and anywhere. It helps us to slow down our breathing and calm our body down so that we can think clearer. Let's give it a try! Place your hands on your stomach and imagine that your stomach is a balloon. Breathe in slowly through your nose and imagine the balloon filling up with air - you should feel your stomach expanding as the balloon gets filled up with air. Then, breathe out slowly through your mouth and imagine the balloon deflating - you should feel your stomach going down. You can slowly count to 5 as you breathe in and out too. Keep breathing like this for a few more times, or until you feel more calm and relaxed. Shall we try it together?"

Firstly, wrap your arms around yourself, so that each hand touches the opposite upper arm or shoulder. Then, move your hands like how the wings of a butterfly flutter, and tap your arms/shoulders gently. Take slow and deep breaths in and out while doing the butterfly hug. You can continue until you feel calmer and more relaxed."

What you can do is to pay attention to your surroundings through your 5 senses. Take a moment to look around your environment and see if you can name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. Let's start off by taking a few deep breaths. Take a look at your surrounding, and see if you can try this 5-4-3-2-1 technique."

For the next one minute, count all the squares that you can where you are right now. Try and identify as many squares as possible.

Imagine that you're doing a relaxing activity or enjoying your favourite snack. Try and visualise more details in your imagination, such as the scenary you can see and the sounds you can hear. Continue to take slow, deep breaths while imagining, until you start to feel more relaxed."

    "label": "coping_reframe negative thoughts",
    "text": "Sometimes our brains come up with thoughts that might not be very friendly or kind about ourselves. These are called automatic negative thoughts, or ANTs for short. ANTs can make us feel not-so-good, just like what you seem to be experiencing now. However, we can learn to turn these negative thoughts into positive ones. This is called reframing. The first step is to identify the negative thoughts. It may sound like \"I'm not good enough\" or \"I can't do it\". Then, ask yourself if those thoughts are 100% true. Sometimes, ANTs like to exaggerate and can trick us into believing that it is true. Next, replace the negative words with something more positive, such as \"I'm good enough and I can be better\" or \"I can't do it yet, and I can try my best\". This is not always easy. You can also ask yourself \"What is a more helpful thought?\", \"What is another possibility?\", \"If my friend had this thought, what would I tell them?\". Reframing takes practice, just like when you learn to ride a bicycle. The more you do it, the better you will become!"

For example, holding a birthday surprise for your sibling or having a surprise gift for a friend. \n\nOn the other hand, unsafe secrets are kept for a long time, and someone threatens or tells you that something bad will happen if you tell. You feel unsafe, uncomfortable or confused keeping the secret. If you don't tell, you or someone else might continue to be hurt or feel unsafe. For example, when an online friend asks you for your personal information or someone touches your private body parts without permission and you feel uncomfortable."
