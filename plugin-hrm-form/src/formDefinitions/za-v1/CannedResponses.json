    "label": "Custody COVID19",
    "text": "Your concern is understandable, as per the Minister of Social Development, a child may be moved between the parents, provided there is a court order, or that a \"parental responsibilities and rights agreement\" or a \"parenting plan\" exists. That plan must be registered with the Family Advocate. The parent transporting the child must have the relevant documentation with them at all times. As a parent, you also have to ensure that nobody in the home that the child is being moved to can have COVID-19 or have come into contact with someone suspected of having the respiratory illness. However, we do discourage the movement of children between parents with joint custody during this time in an attempt to contain COVID-19 and to keep your child safe"

    "label": "District Surgeon",
    "text": "This must be a difficult situation for you. To establish if your son/daughter/child was sexually abused, he/she would have to be taken to a local district surgeon (At your local government hospital) who would examine him/her and fill in a J88 form detailing his/her injuries if any. (However, because of the length of time that has elapsed, the district surgeon might not find any evidence of sexual abuse). Should evidence of sexual abuse be found, he/she can then be taken to Child Welfare as well as the police to lay a charge. A charge may be laid against the person that sexually abused him/her as he/she may be hurting other children as well. We suggest that the child/children receive face to face counselling."

Unfortunately, here at Childline we do not carry out any statutory services like social workers doing home visits and removals, as we are only a counselling service & would have to refer this case to another service like Child Welfare or DSD. Please also bear in mind that due to Lockdown as declared by the President, services like DSD & Child Welfares are under severe strain & may not be able to come out to you as timeously as we would like. Also, due to regulations, some of them are returning to work in a staggered manner or their offices may be closed. If you feel that a child is in immediate danger, please do call the Police on 10111 or the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) Helpline on 08 00 150 150 for a faster response. If you would still like to report this to a social worker, please may I have the area the child is in to provide you with a service closer to the child?"
