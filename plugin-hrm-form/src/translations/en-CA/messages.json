  "WelcomeMsg": "Hi, you've reached a counsellor. What would you like to talk about?",  
  "GoodbyeMsg": "Thank you for using our Live Chat counselling service. We would like to ask you some more questions so we can better understand \n -The reasons young people are reaching out to us for help, and \n-We also want to hear what young people think about our services and ways we can improve. \n\nIf you do not want to answer any of the following questions, you do not have to. It is up to you. If you decide to answer the questions, it will help us a lot and we will never share your answers with anyone, unless we have your permission. We will only share overall results with others (e.g., how all young people responded, not what individual people said). \n\nhttps://survey.alchemer-ca.com/s3/50188874/Post-Chat-Survey"
