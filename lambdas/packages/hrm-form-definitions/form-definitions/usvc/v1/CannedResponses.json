    "text": "If you're not doing so already, it is important to save and document any evidence that you can. This can help show a pattern of behavior over time. Some people document evidence by taking pictures, writing notes in a journal, planner or calendar, using a secure and private email, or making a plan to share evidence with a safe person who can store the information for you. It is ok if you haven't done this yet. When you are able, take time to organize what you can in one place. A victim advocate in your area may be able to assist you with this task. Another thing to be aware of, is keeping a list of resources in a safe place. The resources provided to you in this chat will disappear when the chat ends. This is intended to protect your privacy and safety. If you're unable to find the resources later, or need more resources, you are welcome to contact us again for additional support."

    "label": "Order of Protection (VCRC & DCVH)",
    "text": "A potential resource for your situation could be obtaining an Order of Protection, sometimes referred to as a restraining order, protection order, or other similar title. Your county courthouse is generally a place to start the process, however, many police departments, victim services units, and court advocates at your local domestic or sexual violence and stalking services program might be helpful in assisting you with the application and court process. Protection orders take time and are only effective if you are able and willing to go through the court process and contact law enforcement when the order has been violated. We want to prepare you for what you may encounter when filing for an order of protection. For example, petitions may only be written in English. You can ask if there are interpreter services. You must have the offender/respondent's full name and a good or valid address where the offender/respondent can be found. Additionally, you will need to be ready to describe the events of violence or abuse where you were harmed, intimidated, assaulted, stalked, or otherwise threatened or harmed. Some counties have different protection orders based on your relationship to the offender/respondent and the type of crime you experienced.An advocate at your local domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking program can help prepare you for this. Would you like me to find the nearest advocate, courthouse, and/or police station that can assist you with this process?"

    "text": "There is no \"right way\" or \"wrong way\" to respond to a traumatic event. Every single person's response is unique. Our brains and bodies go into survival-mode, automatically responding in ways that keep us safe. We often react with automatic reflexes and habits that we have very little control over - our brains are wired to do this. Some people call these responses fight, flight, fawn or freeze. These automatic responses are completely normal.However you responded is your body's normal reaction to an abnormal situation. What happened to you is not your fault. You did everything you could do to survive. "

    "text": "What happened to you and how you responded is not your fault. Sometimes we cooperate in the hopes that we will become safe sooner. It is the way our brains and bodies help us survive. Some people call this natural reflex \"fawning\". It has been described by some as \"going into auto-pilot\". It is a normal response that many people experience. \"Going along with it\" or even actively participating does not mean you consented or wanted this experience to happen. It means that you did not feel safe, that saying \"no\" was not an option for you, and that you did what you had to do to survive. "
