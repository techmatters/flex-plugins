  "text": "Thank you for reaching out to The Mix’s PeerChat. Today, you’ll have 45 minutes to talk to a trained supporter about your thoughts and feelings, what’s been going for you and why you have reached out. We can also look for more options that may be able to help further. If you become disconnected at any time during the chat please rejoin the link in your confirmation email.\n\nThe Mix is unable to provide urgent help. If you need urgent help, please visit https://www.themix.org.uk/get-support/urgent-help/\n\nHere at The Mix, we don’t tell anyone outside of the charity what you have shared with us. However, if we felt that you or someone else were in danger, then we would widen the circle of confidentiality by contacting the emergency services. If this were the case, we would tell you straight away and ask you for your details if we haven't got them already. \n\nFor further information, please visit https://www.themix.org.uk/about-us/privacy-centre/privacy-policy/"
