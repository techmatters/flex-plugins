# These requirements are currently duplicated in infrastructure-config:/terraform/Dockerfile
# Eventually we should create a terraform tag for twilio-iac that is built in this repo and
# uses this file and any other requirements specific to this repo, but for now: If you modify
# this file, please also modify the requirements in infrastructure-config:/terraform/Dockerfile
# and build/push a new terraform docker image.
